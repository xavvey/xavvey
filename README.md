Hi, I'm Xavier!

I am quite new to the world of programming and I am trying to learn as much as I can about it! 
Seeing as I love gaming as well, I am also busy teaching myself a little about game development in Unity and getting the hang of C# while I'm at it.

If you have some great resources for me to learn more, don't hesitate to contact me about it.

Have a great day!
